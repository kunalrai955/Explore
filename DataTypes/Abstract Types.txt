Abstract data types
Container
List
Tuple
Multimap (example Associative array)
Set
Multiset (bag)
Stack
Queue (example Priority queue)
Double-ended queue
Graph (example Tree, Heap)
Some properties of abstract data types:

Structure	Order	Unique
List	yes	no
Associative array	no	yes
Set	no	yes
Stack	yes	no
Multimap	no	no
Multiset (bag)	no	no
Queue	yes	no
Order means the insertion sequence counts. Unique means that duplicate elements are not allowed, based on some inbuilt or, alternatively, user-defined rule for comparing elements.
